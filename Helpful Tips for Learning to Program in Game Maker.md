# Helpful Tips for Learning to Program in Game Maker


## Introduction

This post covers some basic guidelines, tips, resources, and practical steps for new programmers - especially for those of us who are doing it purely for fun (and potentially profit) without any prior coding experience or external motivation. A basic disclaimer, I’m not sure whether this makes me more or less qualified to write this, but I’ve only been coding part time for a little over a year and am still very much in the learning process. This tutorial is written as much for myself as for you.

## Helpful Stuff

The following list of guidelines, tips, resources, and practical steps is not meant to be exhaustive (or exhausting) and should serve only as a guideline. They are, perhaps most accurately, a roadmap of my own first year with Game Maker. 

I hope it helps.
